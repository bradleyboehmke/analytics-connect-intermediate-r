## Analytics Connect 2018: Intermediate R

Advancing to an intermediate skill level for any programming language includes understanding how to write efficient code.  This short course will focus on two methods for writing more efficient code with R.  

First, we will discuss how to ___write your own R functions___. Functions allow you to reduce code duplication by automating a generalized task to be applied recursively. Whenever you catch yourself repeating a function or copy-and-pasting code there is a good chance that you should write a function to eliminate the redundancies.  

Second, we will discuss different ___approaches to perform iteration___. Iteration helps you when you need to do the same thing to multiple inputs, such as repeating the same operation on different columns, or on different datasets. 

This course is hands-on so you will need to have R and RStudio pre-installed on your laptop or have access to a server with these software pre-installed.  Any questions about these prerequisites can be sent to Brad Boehmke (bradley.boehmke@8451.com).
